Trinkle - The tiny breakout board for the ATTiny 84
=============

This project is a simple breakout board for the attiny84.

So, having bulk ordered to save a bit of cash, I have a lot of these attiny 84's.  They're a great, cheap little chip and sometimes you just need a few more pins than the 85 has.

This board has such features as: A Power LED, a blink LED attached to D8 and pin spacing to suit a protoboard.  It lacks features like anything else.

Version 2.0 now includes a USB port to upload sketches.  Software coming soon.

There are three sections, the circuit design for kicad, a few photos of the finished product and some working examples..
